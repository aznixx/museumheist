# MUSEUM HEIST - CORE MECHANIC

## OBJECTIVE
The player is a thief. Mission: steal artifact, escape before security catches you.

## PLAYER ACTIONS
- Infiltrate museum (sneak past guards)
- Find & steal artifact (triggers alarm)
- Escape to exit within 4 minutes

## WIN CONDITION
Reach extraction point with artifact within 4 minutes

## LOSE CONDITIONS
- Guard catches you
- Time runs out
- Team separated 30+ seconds (multiplayer)

## KEY MECHANICS
- Walk (silent) vs Run (loud)
- Guards patrol, hear you, chase you
- Hide in shadows, behind objects
- Pick up artifact = 4min timer starts
- No combat (if caught = mission failed)

## WHY IT'S FUN
- Tension: Will we make it?
- Comedy: Guards being stupid, physics fails
- Teamwork: Friends coordinate escapes
- Replayable: Different routes each time
